## Rails 8.0.1 (December 13, 2024)

- Fix a bug in `ERB::Util.tokenize` that causes incorrect tokenization when ERB tags are preceeded by multibyte characters.

  _Martin Emde_

- Restore the ability to decorate methods generated by `class_attribute`.

  It always has been complicated to use Module#prepend or an alias method chain
  to decorate methods defined by `class_attribute`, but became even harder in 8.0.

  This capability is now supported for both reader and writer methods.

## Rails 8.0.0.1 (December 10, 2024)

- No changes.

## Rails 8.0.0 (November 07, 2024)

- No changes.

## Rails 8.0.0.rc2 (October 30, 2024)

- No changes.

## Rails 8.0.0.rc1 (October 19, 2024)

- Remove deprecated support to passing an array of strings to `ActiveSupport::Deprecation#warn`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated support to setting `attr_internal_naming_format` with a `@` prefix.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated `ActiveSupport::ProxyObject`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Don't execute i18n watcher on boot. It shouldn't catch any file changes initially,
  and unnecessarily slows down boot of applications with lots of translations.

  _Gannon McGibbon_, _David Stosik_

- Fix `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess#stringify_keys` to stringify all keys not just symbols.

  Previously:

  ```ruby
  { 1 => 2 }.with_indifferent_access.stringify_keys[1] # => 2
  ```

  After this change:

  ```ruby
  { 1 => 2 }.with_indifferent_access.stringify_keys["1"] # => 2
  ```

  This change can be seen as a bug fix, but since it behaved like this for a very long time, we're deciding
  to not backport the fix and to make the change in a major release.

  _Jean Boussier_

## Rails 8.0.0.beta1 (September 26, 2024)

- Include options when instrumenting `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#delete` and `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#delete_multi`.

  _Adam Renberg Tamm_

- Print test names when running `rails test -v` for parallel tests.

  _John Hawthorn_, _Abeid Ahmed_

- Deprecate `Benchmark.ms` core extension.

  The `benchmark` gem will become bundled in Ruby 3.5

  _Earlopain_

- `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#inspect` now uses ISO 8601 style time like `Time#inspect`

  _John Hawthorn_

- `ActiveSupport::ErrorReporter#report` now assigns a backtrace to unraised exceptions.

  Previously reporting an un-raised exception would result in an error report without
  a backtrace. Now it automatically generates one.

  _Jean Boussier_

- Add `escape_html_entities` option to `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode`.

  This allows for overriding the global configuration found at
  `ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json` for specific calls to `to_json`.

  This should be usable from controllers in the following manner:

  ```ruby
  class MyController < ApplicationController
    def index
      render json: { hello: "world" }, escape_html_entities: false
    end
  end
  ```

  _Nigel Baillie_

- Raise when using key which can't respond to `#to_sym` in `EncryptedConfiguration`.

  As is the case when trying to use an Integer or Float as a key, which is unsupported.

  _zzak_

- Deprecate addition and since between two `Time` and `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`.

  Previously adding time instances together such as `10.days.ago + 10.days.ago` or `10.days.ago.since(10.days.ago)` produced a nonsensical future date. This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 8.1.

  _Nick Schwaderer_

- Support rfc2822 format for Time#to_fs & Date#to_fs.

  _Akshay Birajdar_

- Optimize load time for `Railtie#initialize_i18n`. Filter `I18n.load_path`s passed to the file watcher to only those
  under `Rails.root`. Previously the watcher would grab all available locales, including those in gems
  which do not require a watcher because they won't change.

  _Nick Schwaderer_

- Add a `filter` option to `in_order_of` to prioritize certain values in the sorting without filtering the results
  by these values.

  _Igor Depolli_

- Improve error message when using `assert_difference` or `assert_changes` with a
  proc by printing the proc's source code (MRI only).

  _Richard Böhme_, _Jean Boussier_

- Add a new configuration value `:zone` for `ActiveSupport.to_time_preserves_timezone` and rename the previous `true` value to `:offset`. The new default value is `:zone`.

  _Jason Kim_, _John Hawthorn_

- Align instrumentation `payload[:key]` in ActiveSupport::Cache to follow the same pattern, with namespaced and normalized keys.

  _Frederik Erbs Spang Thomsen_

- Fix `travel_to` to set usec 0 when `with_usec` is `false` and the given argument String or DateTime.
