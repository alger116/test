_**Assistant**_

To add the footer to the bottom of your landing page, you can ensure that it is positioned correctly and styled appropriately. Based on the provided HTML snippet, here's how you can integrate it into your existing layout.

### Plan
1. **Ensure the footer is fixed at the bottom**: The current footer is already set to be fixed at the bottom with `fixed bottom-0`. This is good for a sticky footer.
2. **Check the container**: Make sure the main content of your landing page has enough height to push the footer down if the content is short.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the footer is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.

### Code Update
Here’s the updated code snippet to ensure the footer is correctly integrated into your landing page:

```html:index.html (lines 352-362)
<footer
    class="bg-opacity-80 from-blue-500 to-indigo-600 text-black py-2 fixed bottom-0 left-0 w-full shadow-md backdrop-blur-md">
    <div class="container justify-between items-center px-6 text-sm hidden">
        <p class="text-sm">&copy; 2025 Riigihanke Andmed. Kõik õigused kaitstud.</p>
        <div class="space-x-2 hidden">
            <a href="#" class="hover:underline">Lingid</a>
            <a href="#" class="hover:underline">Kasutusjuhend</a>
            <a href="#" class="hover:underline">Kontakt</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</footer>
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Visibility of Content**: If the footer content is hidden (as indicated by `hidden` classes), you may want to make it visible based on certain conditions (like screen size).
- **Main Content Height**: Ensure your main content area has enough height to push the footer down when the content is short. You might need to add a `min-h-screen` class to your main content container.
