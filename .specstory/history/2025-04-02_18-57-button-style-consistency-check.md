I'll help you make the "Riigihanke andmed" button visually consistent with the "Avalehele" button. I notice that the "Avalehele" button has proper padding and styling, while the "Riigihanke andmed" button has some inconsistencies.

Let me fix the styling to match:


---

```diff
                      </a>
                      <h1
-                         class="x-3 py-1.5 text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-200 hover:text-black transition transform hover:scale-105 items-center flex protected-section">
+                         class="px-3 py-1.5 text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-200 hover:text-black transition transform hover:scale-105 items-center flex protected-section">
                          <a href="index.html" class="hover">Riigihanke andmed</a>
                      </h1>
```

I've made the following changes to make the buttons visually consistent:
1. Fixed the padding class from `x-3` to `px-3` to match the Avalehele button
2. Kept all other styling classes the same since they were already matching

Now both buttons will have:
- Same padding (px-3 py-1.5)
- Same text size (text-lg)
- Same font weight (font-bold)
- Same text color (text-gray-800)
- Same hover effects (hover:bg-blue-200, hover:text-black)
- Same transition and transform effects
- Same flex layout

The buttons should now look identical in terms of styling and hover behavior.
