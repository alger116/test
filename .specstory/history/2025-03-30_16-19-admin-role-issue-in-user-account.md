_**Assistant**_

It seems like you're encountering an issue where your account, which is supposed to have the `mainAdmin` role, is showing `isAdmin: false`. This could be due to a few reasons, such as how the user roles are being set or retrieved from Firestore.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue

1. **Check User Creation Logic**: Ensure that when a user is created or updated, the `isAdmin` property is set correctly based on the role. In your code, the `isAdmin` property should be set to `true` for the `mainAdmin` role.

2. **Inspect Firestore Data**: Check the Firestore database to see if the `isAdmin` field is being stored correctly for your user. You can do this by navigating to the Firestore console and looking at the user document.

3. **Update User Role Logic**: When you are assigning roles, ensure that the logic correctly assigns the `isAdmin` property based on the role. 

### Suggested Code Changes

Here’s how you can ensure that the `isAdmin` property is set correctly when creating or updating a user:

#### Update User Creation Logic

In the section where you create a new user, ensure that the `isAdmin` property is set based on the role:

```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
    email: email,
    role: role,
    approved: approved,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    lastLogin: null,
    status: approved ? 'active' : 'pending',
    uid: user.uid,
    emailVerified: false,
    lastUpdated: new Date(),
    createdBy: auth.currentUser.uid,
    createdByEmail: auth.currentUser.email,
    isAdmin: role === 'mainAdmin' // Set isAdmin based on role
});
```

#### Update User Role Logic

When updating a user's role, ensure that the `isAdmin` property is updated accordingly:

```javascript
await updateDoc(userRef, {
    role: newRole,
    lastUpdated: new Date(),
    updatedBy: auth.currentUser.uid,
    updatedByEmail: auth.currentUser.email,
    isAdmin: newRole === 'mainAdmin' // Update isAdmin based on new role
});
```

### Verify Changes

After making these changes, test the following:

- Create a new user with the `mainAdmin` role and check if `isAdmin` is set to `true`.
- Update an existing user’s role to `mainAdmin` and verify that `isAdmin` is updated accordingly.

### Conclusion

By ensuring that the `isAdmin` property is set correctly during user creation and updates, you should be able to resolve the issue where your account is not recognized as an admin. If the problem persists, consider checking the Firestore security rules to ensure they allow the necessary read/write operations for the `isAdmin` field.

_**Assistant**_

If you can't access the admin panel due to your account not being recognized as a `mainAdmin`, you'll need to troubleshoot the issue from a different angle. Here are some steps you can take to regain access:

### Steps to Regain Access to the Admin Panel

1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure that you are logged in with the correct account that should have `mainAdmin` privileges. If you have multiple accounts, make sure you are using the one associated with the `mainAdmin` role.

2. **Directly Modify Firestore**: If you have access to the Firestore console, you can manually update your user document to set the `role` to `mainAdmin` and `isAdmin` to `true`. Here’s how to do it:
   - Go to the Firestore console.
   - Navigate to the `users` collection.
   - Find your user document (using the email or UID).
   - Update the fields:
     ```json
     {
       "role": "mainAdmin",
       "isAdmin": true
     }
     ```

3. **Use a Different Admin Account**: If there are other admin accounts available, log in with one of those accounts to access the admin panel and make the necessary changes to your account.

4. **Check Firestore Security Rules**: Ensure that your Firestore security rules allow the current user to read and write their own user document. If the rules are too restrictive, you may not be able to access or modify your user data.

5. **Debugging the Code**: If you have access to the codebase, you can add temporary logging to the authentication and role-checking logic to see why your account is not being recognized as an admin. For example, you can log the user data retrieved from Firestore when you check for admin access.

### Example of Logging User Data

You can add logging in the `checkAccess` function to see what role is being retrieved:

```javascript
async function checkAccess() {
    const currentUser = auth.currentUser
    if (!currentUser) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", currentUser.uid))
    const userData = userDoc.data()

    console.log("Current User Data:", userData) // Log user data for debugging

    if (!userData) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    // Check if user has access to the current page
    // ...
}
```

### Conclusion

If you cannot access the admin panel due to role issues, the quickest solution is to directly modify your user document in Firestore. If you have other admin accounts, use them to regain access. If you continue to face issues, consider reviewing the authentication and role-checking logic in your codebase.

see the problem is with localstorage ?

irestore roll: mainAdmin

_**Assistant**_

It looks like the issue may indeed be related to how the user role and `isAdmin` status are being stored in `localStorage`. If your Firestore role is correctly set to `mainAdmin`, but `localStorage` is showing `isAdmin: false`, this discrepancy could prevent you from accessing the admin panel.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix the LocalStorage Issue

1. **Check LocalStorage Logic**: Review the code where you are setting the `isAdmin` property in `localStorage`. Ensure that it correctly reflects the role fetched from Firestore.

2. **Update LocalStorage on Role Change**: Whenever you fetch user data from Firestore, make sure to update `localStorage` accordingly. If the role is `mainAdmin`, set `isAdmin` to `true`.

3. **Clear LocalStorage**: If the localStorage is outdated or incorrect, you can clear it and let your application repopulate it with the correct values upon the next login.

### Example Code to Update LocalStorage

Here’s how you can ensure that `localStorage` is updated correctly when you fetch user data:

```javascript
async function checkAccess() {
    const currentUser = auth.currentUser
    if (!currentUser) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", currentUser.uid))
    const userData = userDoc.data()

    if (!userData) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    // Update localStorage based on Firestore data
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
        email: userData.email,
        id: userData.uid,
        role: userData.role,
        isAdmin: userData.role === 'mainAdmin' // Set isAdmin based on role
    }));

    // Check if user has access to the current page
    // ...
}
```

### Clear LocalStorage

If you suspect that the localStorage is causing issues, you can clear it manually in the browser's developer tools or programmatically:

```javascript
localStorage.clear(); // This will remove all items from localStorage
```

### Conclusion

By ensuring that `localStorage` is updated correctly based on the role fetched from Firestore, you can resolve the issue of `isAdmin` being set to `false` despite having the `mainAdmin` role. If you continue to experience issues, consider debugging the flow of data from Firestore to localStorage to identify where the discrepancy occurs.

_**Assistant**_

To address the issue with `localStorage` not reflecting the correct `isAdmin` status for your `mainAdmin` role, you need to ensure that the logic for updating `localStorage` is correctly implemented in your code. Below are the specific updates you should make to your existing code.

### Update the `checkAccess` Function

You need to modify the `checkAccess` function to ensure that it updates `localStorage` correctly based on the user's role fetched from Firestore. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Updated Code for `checkAccess`

Find the `checkAccess` function in your JavaScript code and update it as follows:

```javascript
async function checkAccess() {
    const currentUser = auth.currentUser
    if (!currentUser) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", currentUser.uid))
    const userData = userDoc.data()

    if (!userData) {
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    // Update localStorage based on Firestore data
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
        email: userData.email,
        id: userData.uid,
        role: userData.role,
        isAdmin: userData.role === 'mainAdmin' // Set isAdmin based on role
    }));

    console.log("Updated localStorage:", JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))); // Log updated user data

    // Check if user has access to the current page
    const currentPage = window.location.pathname
    const isOMPage = currentPage.includes('om.html')
    const isHMPage = currentPage.includes('hm.html')

    if (isOMPage && !hasWorldAccess(userData.role, 'om')) {
        showNotification("Sul ei ole õigusi Ostumaailma lehele!", "error")
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    if (isHMPage && !hasWorldAccess(userData.role, 'hm')) {
        showNotification("Sul ei ole õigusi Hankemaailma lehele!", "error")
        window.location.href = "/index.html"
        return
    }

    // Update UI based on permissions
    updateUIForRole(userData.role)
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Update LocalStorage**: The code now sets `isAdmin` to `true` if the user's role is `mainAdmin`. This ensures that the localStorage reflects the correct admin status.

2. **Logging**: A console log statement is added to verify the updated localStorage data. This will help you debug and confirm that the values are being set correctly.

### Clear LocalStorage (Optional)

If you want to ensure that any outdated data is removed before the new data is set, you can clear the localStorage at the beginning of the `checkAccess` function:

```javascript
localStorage.clear(); // Clear localStorage at the start
```

### Conclusion

After making these updates, your `localStorage` should correctly reflect the `isAdmin` status based on the user's role. Test the changes by logging in with your account and checking the console for the updated localStorage values. If you still encounter issues, let me know, and we can further troubleshoot.
