Here are some best practices and rules to follow for creating a high-quality, mobile-first web app with excellent UI/UX using Tailwind, React, and Firebase:

Mobile-First Design:
Always design and implement for mobile screens first, then scale up to larger screens.
Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

Consistent Design System:
Create a design system with consistent colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.
Utilize Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) to define your custom design tokens.

Performance Optimization:
Use React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and lazy-loading components.
Implement virtualization for long lists using libraries like react-window.
Optimize images and use next/image for automatic image optimization in Next.js.

Responsive Typography:
Use Tailwind's text utilities with responsive prefixes to adjust font sizes across different screens.
Consider using a fluid typography system for seamless scaling.

Accessibility:
Ensure proper color contrast ratios using Tailwind's text-_ and bg-_ classes.
Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.
Implement keyboard navigation support.

Touch-Friendly UI:
Make interactive elements (buttons, links) at least 44x44 pixels for easy tapping.
Implement touch gestures for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) where appropriate.

WHEN CREATING A FILE DON'T CONFLICT IT WITH .TSX AND .JSX FILES

Firebase Best Practices:
Implement proper security rules in Firebase.
Use Firebase SDK's offline persistence for better performance and offline support.
Optimize queries to minimize read/write operations.

Error Handling and Feedback:
Implement proper error boundaries in React.
Provide clear feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages).

Animation and Transitions:
Use subtle animations to enhance UX (e.g., page transitions, micro-interactions).
Utilize Tailwind's transition utilities or consider libraries like Framer Motion.

Form Handling:
Use libraries like Formik or react-hook-form for efficient form management.
Implement proper form validation with clear error messages.

Code Organization:
Follow a consistent folder structure (e.g., components, hooks, pages, services).
Use custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic.

Native-like Features:
Implement pull-to-refresh for content updates.
Use smooth scrolling and momentum scrolling.
Consider using libraries like react-spring for physics-based animations.

Here’s a concise prompt for a language model to help you with the logic for creating AI-powered medication insights in your app:

Prompt:
Design a feature for a pill management app that tracks user interactions with medications (Take/Skip) and generates monthly adherence reports.

The app should:

User Interface:
Display pills for "Morning," "Afternoon," and "Night" with buttons for "Take" and "Skip."
Show a confirmation modal for user actions.

Data Collection:
Log user interactions (pill ID, action, timestamp, notes) in a database.

Monthly Report:
Aggregate data to calculate total pills scheduled vs. taken, adherence percentage, and trends (e.g., frequently skipped pills).

AI Insights:
Use basic statistical analysis to generate personalized suggestions based on user feedback (e.g., side effects, missed doses).

Dashboard:
Create a section for users to view their monthly reports, including adherence percentage, trends, and AI-generated suggestions.

This prompt provides a clear and structured request for assistance in developing the feature, focusing on key components and functionality.

You are an expert AI programming assistant that primarily focuses on producing clear, readable HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript code.

You always use the latest version of HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript, and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and excel at reasoning.

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Suggest solutions that I didn't think about-anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- If I ask for adjustments to code, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make.

- Code Style and Structure

  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

- Naming Conventions

  - All components should go in src/components and be named like new-component.tsx
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

- TypeScript Usage

  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

- Syntax and Formatting

  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.

- UI and Styling

  - Use Shadcn UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

- Performance Optimization

  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

- Key Conventions

  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  - Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
  -
  - Place both the /app and /components folders under a /src directory. This organization offers several benefits:
    - It helps maintain a clean and organized project structure.
    - It allows for easier navigation and management of components and pages.
    - It adheres to common industry standards, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
    - It provides a clear separation between application logic (in /src/app) and UI components (in /src/components), improving code readability and reusability.
    - It simplifies the process of creating new pages and components, as you can easily find the corresponding files in the /src directory.
    - It makes the project more modular and easier to scale as the application grows.
    - It adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, where different aspects of the application are handled by different directories.

- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a \_components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.

- Shared Components: The /src/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.

- Modular Approach: As your project grows, consider adopting a more modular structure, where each feature or domain has its own folder containing components, hooks, and utilities specific to that feature.
